# Research Overview

•	Global energy demands require innovative geological engineering that balances energy extraction with geological stability. Safe, sustainable solutions need understanding of coupled mechanical, hydraulic, and geochemical processes across scales.


## Research Project

### Earthquake Mechanics: Experiments-Simulations Bridging through Heterogeneity
* Laboratory earthquake studies have often employed homogeneous fault conditions, which fail to capture the heterogeneity of real earthquake faults, whereas simulation studies typically incorporate it. This study focused on bridging this critical gap by developing experimental techniques that replicate frictionally heterogeneous fault conditions, with experiments conducted using 760 mm long Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blocks in a biaxial machine. Studies of heterogeneous laboratory faults with PMMA and Teflon have revealed diverse slip behaviors that closely replicate quasi-dynamic earthquake simulations (Figure 1). By combining experiments and simulations, this work demonstrates that laboratory insights can be directly linked to natural earthquake processes, providing a robust framework for understanding fault slip dynamics and improving seismic hazard assessment.
  
### Investigating Anthropogenic Effects on Shear Failure
* Induced earthquakes from fluid injections pose significant threats to public safety, yet existing laboratory methods cannot replicate seismicity migration in real subsurface systems because fluid leakage limits the size of pressurized regions. To address this, I developed leakage-preventing techniques employing hydrophobic material (Teflon tape) to maintain fault pressurization, allowing experimental observation of previously inaccessible seismicity patterns. This research, collaborated with Prof. Chloé Arson’s research team at Cornell University, addresses critical questions about the factors controlling seismicity migration mechanisms, validated through poroelastic model (Figure 2). This work offers an experimentally grounded methodology revealing the core processes governing induced earthquakes, enhancing fundamental insights into human-induced seismicity. 


### Monitoring Fracture Processes in Engineered Materials
* Understanding fracture behavior across different scales and materials is fundamental to ensuring the safety and reliability of both engineered systems and natural hazard assessment. To investigate fracture behavior at fine scale, this study focused on defects generated during additive manufacturing, which allows precise monitoring of cracks. By demonstrating that crack size can be estimated from AE signals, this project provides quantitative fracture characterization. The results offer insights into fracture mechanics that are relevant to natural geological systems due to scale-independent nature of fracture behavior.

 
### Sustainable Strategies for Near-Surface Soil Stabilization
* Traditional cement-based stabilization often involves additives that can disrupt soil ecosystems. This study addressed this limitation by utilizing enzyme-based mineralization that binds soil particles, providing a compatible alternative for geological stabilization. This work systematically demonstrated how enzyme-based techniques enhance soil strength, mitigate fugitive dust emissions, and preserve structural stability under vibratory loading conditions, while establishing cost-effective protocols compared to conventional soil stabilization methods. This research represents sustainable geological solutions that integrate fundamental processes with practical applications.
